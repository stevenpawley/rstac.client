\usage{
raster_band(
  nodata = NULL,
  data_type = NULL,
  unit = NULL,
  statistics = NULL,
  sampling = NULL,
  bits_per_sample = NULL,
  spatial_resolution = NULL,
  scale = NULL,
  offset = NULL,
  histogram = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodata}{(numeric or NULL, optional) Pixel value(s) that should be
interpreted as "no data". Can be a single value or vector of values.
Common values: 0, -9999, NaN.}

\item{data_type}{(character, optional) Data type of the band. Must be one of:
"int8", "int16", "int32", "int64", "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "uint64",
"float16", "float32", "float64", "cint16", "cint32", "cfloat32", "cfloat64",
or "other".}

\item{unit}{(character, optional) Unit of measurement for the pixel values.
Examples: "m" (meters), "W⋅sr⁻¹⋅m⁻²" (radiance), "1" (unitless/reflectance).}

\item{statistics}{(list, optional) Statistics object created with
\code{raster_statistics()} describing the distribution of pixel values.}

\item{sampling}{(character, optional) Pixel sampling method. Either "area"
(pixel represents area) or "point" (pixel represents point). Default is "area".}

\item{bits_per_sample}{(integer, optional) Actual number of bits used for
this band. Only needed when different from the standard for the data type
(e.g., 1-bit data stored in uint8).}

\item{spatial_resolution}{(numeric, optional) Average spatial resolution of
pixels in the band, in meters. Useful when resolution varies or differs
from ground sample distance (gsd).}

\item{scale}{(numeric, optional) Multiplicative scaling factor to transform
pixel values: \verb{physical_value = scale × DN + offset}. Default is 1.}

\item{offset}{(numeric, optional) Additive offset to transform pixel values:
\verb{physical_value = scale × DN + offset}. Default is 0.}

\item{histogram}{(list, optional) Histogram object created with
\code{raster_histogram()} describing the distribution of pixel values.}

\item{...}{Additional fields for the band object. Can include fields from
other extensions like \code{"eo:common_name"}, \code{"eo:center_wavelength"}.}
}
\value{
A list representing a raster band object.
}
\description{
Creates a band object for use with the Raster Extension. Describes the
characteristics of a single raster band including data type, nodata values,
scale/offset transforms, and statistics.

\examples{
# Simple band with just data type
band <- raster_band(data_type = "uint8")

# Band with nodata and scale/offset
band <- raster_band(
  nodata = 0,
  data_type = "uint16",
  scale = 0.0001,
  offset = 0,
  unit = "1"
)

# Band with statistics
band <- raster_band(
  nodata = -9999,
  data_type = "int16",
  spatial_resolution = 30,
  statistics = raster_statistics(
    minimum = -1000,
    maximum = 8000,
    mean = 2500,
    stddev = 1500
  )
)

# Band combining raster and EO extension
band <- raster_band(
  nodata = 0,
  data_type = "uint16",
  scale = 0.0001,
  offset = -0.1,
  spatial_resolution = 10,
  unit = "1",
  "eo:common_name" = "red",
  "eo:center_wavelength" = 0.665,
  "eo:full_width_half_max" = 0.038
)
