}
\arguments{
\item{name}{(character, optional) Name of the band as given by the data provider
(e.g., "B01", "B02", "B1", "B5", "QA").}

\item{common_name}{(character, optional) Common name of the band. Should be
one of the standard names if applicable: "coastal", "blue", "green", "red",
"rededge", "rededge071", "rededge075", "rededge078", "nir", "nir08", "nir09",
"cirrus", "swir16", "swir22", "lwir", "lwir11", "lwir12", "pan".}

\item{description}{(character, optional) Description to fully explain the band.
CommonMark 0.29 syntax may be used for rich text representation.}

\item{center_wavelength}{(numeric, optional) Center wavelength of the band in
micrometers (μm). For example, the red band might be 0.665.}

\item{full_width_half_max}{(numeric, optional) Full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the band, in micrometers (μm). This is the width of the band as
measured at half the maximum transmission.}

\item{solar_illumination}{(numeric, optional) Solar illumination value for the
band, as measured at the top of atmosphere. Used in atmospheric correction
and radiometric calibration.}

\item{...}{Additional fields for the band object. Can include fields from other
extensions like raster fields (\code{nodata}, \code{data_type}, \code{raster:scale}, etc.).}
}
\value{
A list representing an EO band object.
}
\description{
Creates a band object for use with the Electro-Optical (EO) Extension.
Describes the characteristics of a spectral band including wavelength
information and common names.
}
\details{
\subsection{Common Names}{

The use of \code{common_name} is recommended when the band corresponds to a standard
spectral region. This enables interoperability across different sensors and
platforms. For custom or non-standard bands, use the \code{name} field with a
descriptive \code{description}.
}

\subsection{Wavelength Specification}{

Wavelengths should be specified in micrometers (μm). For example:
\itemize{
\item Blue: ~0.49 μm (490 nm)
\item Green: ~0.56 μm (560 nm)
\item Red: ~0.66 μm (660 nm)
\item NIR: ~0.86 μm (860 nm)
}
}

\subsection{Combining with Raster Extension}{

EO bands can be combined with raster metadata by adding raster fields to the
same band object. Common raster fields include \code{nodata}, \code{data_type},
\code{raster:scale}, \code{raster:offset}, \code{raster:spatial_resolution}.
