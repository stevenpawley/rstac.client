\usage{
raster_histogram(count, min, max, buckets)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{(integer, required) Number of buckets in the histogram.}

\item{min}{(numeric, required) Lower bound of the histogram.}

\item{max}{(numeric, required) Upper bound of the histogram.}

\item{buckets}{(integer vector, required) Array of counts for each bucket.
Length must equal \code{count}.}

\examples{
# Simple histogram with 5 buckets
hist <- raster_histogram(
  count = 5,
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  buckets = c(1500, 3200, 4100, 2800, 1400)
)
