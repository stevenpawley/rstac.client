\title{Validate Extent Object}
\usage{
validate_extent(extent)
}
\description{
Validates the spatial and temporal extent fields of a STAC Collection.
Checks for required bbox and interval fields and ensures proper structure.
}
\details{
The extent object must contain two required fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{spatial}: Contains a \code{bbox} field with a list of one or more bounding boxes.
Each bounding box must be a numeric vector of length 4 (2D: c(west, south, east, north))
or 6 (3D: c(west, south, min_elevation, east, north, max_elevation)).
\item \code{temporal}: Contains an \code{interval} field with a time interval.
The time interval must be a vector of 2 elements representing start and end times
(as character or NA for open-ended intervals).
}
